# risk-management
In this project given porfolios composed of both stocks and derivatives the aim is to compute key risk measures comparing different techniques. 
In particular the adopted techniques are: closed formulas for VaR and ES in presence of losses following a t-student distribution to better capture the phenomenon of heavy tails, then we exploited also non-parametric approaches like: historical simulation both weighted and non-weighted, bootstrap and PCA.
In order to properly compute the VaR in presence of non linear portfolios also Full Monte-Carlo and delta-normal approaches were exploited.
Finally we also priced a cliquet option in presence of counterparty risk.
